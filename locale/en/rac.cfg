rac-input-label=Input Signal Handling
rac-input-output-label=Input/Output Signal Handling
rac-output-label=Output Signal Handling
rac-research-mode=Modify research queue
rac-research-mode-description=Change the research queue based on the input signal.
rac-queue-tech-replace=Replace entire queue
rac-queue-tech-replace-description=Clears the research queue, then adds the input technologies to it.
rac-queue-tech-front=Add to front of queue
rac-queue-tech-front-description=Adds missing technologies to the front of the queue.
rac-queue-tech-back=Add to back of queue
rac-queue-tech-back-description=Add missing technologies to back of the queue.
rac-io-mode-label=Output mode
rac-io-mode-input-value=Output values derived from input
rac-io-mode-input-value-description=The value of output signals will be based on the input signal values.\n\nFor example, the input is the [font=default-bold]Logistics[/font] technology signal with a signal value of 4, and [font=default-bold]Get technology pre-requisites[/font] is selected, then the output will be the [font=default-bold]Automation Science Pack[/font] technology signal, also with a value of 4.  This mode is useful for multiplexing multiple input signals.
rac-io-mode-input-context=Output values based on context
rac-io-mode-input-context-description=The value of the output signals will be either 1 or a context dependent value.\n\nFor output technologies this will be the level of the technology - which is useful for infinite techs.
rac-output-signals=Output Signals
rac-research-get-prereq=Get technology pre-requisites
rac-research-get-prereq-description=Get the technologies that must be researched before technologies in input signals.  When [font=default-bold]Output values derived from input[/font] is selected, output values will match each input signal.  When context-based output is selected, the level of each prerequisite technology will be output.
rac-research-get-successors=Get technology successors
rac-research-get-successors-description=Get the technologies that can be researched after technologies in input signals.  When [font=default-bold]Output values derived from input[/font] is selected, output values will match each input signal.  When context-based output is selected, the level of each successor technology will be output.
rac-research-get-recipes=Get recipes unlocked by technology
rac-research-get-recipes-description=Get the recipes that are unlocked by technologies in input signals.  When [font=default-bold]Output values derived from input[/font] is selected, output values will match each input signal.  When context-based output is selected, each recipe will output a value of 1.
rac-research-get-items=Get items unlocked by technology
rac-research-get-items-description=Get the items that are unlocked by technologies in input signals.  When [font=default-bold]Output values derived from input[/font] is selected, output values will match each input signal.  When context-based output is selected, each item will output a value of 1.
rac-research-get-science-packs=Get science packs for technology
rac-research-get-science-packs-description=Get the science packs (or items) used to research the technologies in input signals.  When [font=default-bold]Output values derived from input[/font] is selected, output values will match each input signal.  When context-based output is selected, the output will be the required count per research increment.

rac-research-current=Read current research
rac-research-current-description=Outputs the technology that is currently being researched.
rac-research-current-percent=Read research progress (%)
rac-research-current-percent-description=Outputs the current research progress as a percentage value (0-100).
rac-research-current-percent-label=Percent
rac-research-current-percent-label-description=The current research progress percentage of the technology being researched.
rac-research-current-value=Read research progress (value)
rac-research-current-value-description=Outputs the current (C) and remaining (R) research progress as numeric values out of the total research (T).
rac-research-current-current-label=Current progress
rac-research-current-current-label-description=The current research progress of the technology being researched.
rac-research-current-remaining-label=Remaining progress
rac-research-current-remaining-label-description=The remaining amount of research required to complete the technology being researched.
rac-research-current-total-label=Total research
rac-research-current-total-label-description=The total research amount required for the technology being researched.

rac-research-status=Read research status
rac-research-status-description=Outputs the current research state of technologies.
rac-research-status-researched=Researched technologies
rac-research-status-researched-description=Technologies that have already been researched.
rac-research-status-available=Available technologies
rac-research-status-available-description=Technologies that can be researched (all prerequisites met).
rac-research-status-unresearched=Unresearched technologies
rac-research-status-unresearched-description=Technologies that have not yet been researched.
